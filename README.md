- 👋 Hi, I’m @Squirrelthug
- 👀 I’m interested in learning java again after I finish learning Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python but I'm interested in working with Unity to develop for VR and AR technologies.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I have the skills to help with.
- 📫 You can reach me here.
