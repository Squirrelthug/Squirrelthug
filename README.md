- 👋 Hi, I’m @Squirrelthug
- 👀 I’m interested in learning java again after I finish learning Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3 but I'm interested in working with Unity to develop for VR and AR technologies.
- ✨ I would eventually like to develop an alternative to tabletop or digital tabletop gaming with a more immersive experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I have the skills to help with.
- 📫 You can reach me here.
